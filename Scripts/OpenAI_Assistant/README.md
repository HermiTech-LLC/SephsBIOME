# SEPHSbiome GPT-VSCode API Integration

## Overview
This documentation outlines the integration of a Flask-based API with the SEPHSbiome project for enhanced development workflows, leveraging GPT models, Visual Studio Code (VSCode) debugging, and external services for comprehensive project management.

## Setup

### Install Dependencies
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Install Flask using `pip install flask`.
- Install additional dependencies such as `requests`, `sqlite3`, and any necessary libraries for GitHub, Sentry, or Docker integration.

### External Service Configuration
- Set up Sentry, GitHub, and Docker configurations for error tracking, CI/CD, and container management.
- Configure environment variables like `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` for secure API interactions.
- Utilize a `.env` file or a secure environment variable management system for sensitive configurations.

### Project Directory Preparation
- Place `api.py` (the Flask API script) and `schema.yaml` (the OpenAPI specification) in your project directory.
- Ensure that the `api.py` script reflects the logic for interacting with GPT models, VSCode, and external services.
- Ensure any necessary configuration files or settings are correctly set up for integration.

## Flask Server Execution
- Start the server with `python api.py`. The server will listen for incoming requests to handle GPT actions, VSCode debugging commands, and external service interactions.

## API Endpoints
- **`/github/dispatch-workflow`**: Triggers a GitHub Actions workflow for automated CI/CD processes.
- **`/vscode/command`**: Executes commands in VSCode via integrated extensions or direct command execution.
- **`/sentry/issues`**: Fetches recent issues and errors from Sentry for real-time error tracking.
- **`/sqlite/query`**: Performs database operations on an SQLite database.
- **`/docker/run-container`**: Manages Docker containers to execute or deploy applications in isolated environments.

## Security and Error Handling
- **Authentication**: Use environment variables to store API tokens and implement header-based authentication for secure access.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data to prevent SQL injection and other malicious attacks, particularly for endpoints like `/sqlite/query`.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks and excessive traffic, using tools like Flask-Limiter.
- **Error Handling**: Create comprehensive error handling to manage invalid requests, server errors, and external service failures gracefully.

## Documentation
- **API Schema**: Consult the `schema.yaml` for in-depth API structure, request/response formats, and descriptions of each endpoint.
- **Maintenance**: Keep the documentation and API schema updated to mirror any changes in the API endpoints or functionality.

## Testing and Validation
- Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or Swagger UI.
- Write and maintain unit tests for the Flask application to ensure endpoint reliability and functionality.

## Deployment and Accessibility
- Include instructions for deploying the API, possibly on a cloud platform.
- Ensure the API is accessible to the intended users or systems, especially if integrated with OpenAI or other external platforms.

## Additional Notes
- Customize the API script to integrate with the specific tools and services used within the SEPHSbiome project.
- Use VSCode extensions that best fit the development practices and project requirements.
- Regularly review and test the API to ensure it meets the evolving needs of the SEPHSbiome project.
