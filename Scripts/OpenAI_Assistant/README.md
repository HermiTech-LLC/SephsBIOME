# SEPHSbiome GPT-VSCode API Integration

## Overview
This documentation outlines the integration of a Flask-based API within the SEPHSbiome project. It leverages GPT models and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) debugging, along with external services like GitHub, Sentry, and Docker, to enhance development workflows and offer robust project management tools.

## Setup

### Install Dependencies
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- Install Flask: `pip install flask`.
- Install additional dependencies: `pip install flask_jwt_extended requests`.
- For SQLite integration, Pythonâ€™s built-in `sqlite3` module is used.
- Ensure `subprocess` module availability for Docker and VSCode integration.

### External Service Configuration
- Set up Sentry, GitHub, and Docker for error tracking, CI/CD, and container management.
- Configure environment variables like `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, and Docker-related settings.
- Utilize a `.env` file or a secure environment variable management system for sensitive configurations.

### Project Directory Preparation
- Place `api.py` (the Flask API script) and `schema.yaml` (the OpenAPI specification) in your project directory.
- Ensure `api.py` includes logic for GPT model interactions, VSCode commands, and external services.
- Check all necessary configuration files and settings for proper integration.

## Flask Server Execution
- Start the server with `python api.py`. The server listens for incoming requests related to GPT actions, VSCode debugging commands, and external service interactions.

## API Endpoints
- **`/api/v1/github/dispatch-workflow`**: Triggers a GitHub Actions workflow for automated CI/CD processes.
- **`/api/v1/vscode/command`**: Executes commands in VSCode through integrated extensions or direct command execution.
- **`/api/v1/sentry/issues`**: Fetches recent issues and errors from Sentry for real-time error tracking.
- **`/api/v1/sqlite/query`**: Conducts database operations on an SQLite database.
- **`/api/v1/docker/run-container`**: Manages Docker containers to execute or deploy applications in isolated environments.

## Security and Error Handling
- **Authentication**: Use JWT for secure access and store API tokens in environment variables.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data to prevent SQL injection and other malicious attacks, particularly for `/api/v1/sqlite/query`.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting with Flask-Limiter to protect against brute force attacks and excessive traffic.
- **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive error handling to manage invalid requests, server errors, and external service failures gracefully.

## Documentation
- **API Schema**: Refer to `schema.yaml` for a detailed structure of the API, including request/response formats and endpoint descriptions.
- **Maintenance**: Keep the documentation and API schema updated to reflect changes in API endpoints or functionalities.

## Testing and Validation
- Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or Swagger UI.
- Write and maintain unit tests for the Flask application to ensure the reliability and functionality of endpoints.

## Deployment and Accessibility
- Provide deployment instructions, potentially for cloud platforms.
- Ensure the API is accessible to intended users or systems, especially if integrated with OpenAI or other external services.

## Additional Notes
- Customize the API script to integrate with specific tools and services in the SEPHSbiome project.
- Choose VSCode extensions that align with your development practices and project requirements.
- Regularly review and test the API to ensure it meets the evolving needs of the SEPHSbiome project.
