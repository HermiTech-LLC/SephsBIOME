# Seph's Biome 🌿🤖

## Overview

Seph's Biome represents a pioneering venture in the realm of robotic operating systems, blending the intricacies of robotics, computer science, and evolutionary biology. The project focuses on the exploration of artificial evolution, with the objective of replicating and analyzing complex biological behaviors in a computational environment.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
- Python - latest release 🐍
- ROS Noetic (future updates to Foxy planned) 🤖
- Docker (optional) 🐳

### Setup
To begin, clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/SephsBIOME.git'
cd SephsBIOME
```

*Note: Full functionality will be available upon project completion.* 🌟
### Running the Project
Start the project using:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
although, i plan to provide an executable .sh or something, upon 
release... 😅haven't gotten that far.
## Capabilities and Goals 🎯

Seph's Biome integrates concepts from robotics, AI, and biology, aiming to achieve:
- **Robotic Simulation**: Employing ROS to simulate realistic robotic behaviors across different scenarios. 🤖
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Using genetic algorithms to foster the evolution of intricate robotic behaviors. 🧬
- **Neural Network Integration**: Embedding neural networks for enhanced decision-making and adaptive learning. 🧠
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Efficient management of sensor data, crucial for real-time decision-making and performance monitoring. ⏱️
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Offering real-time visualization tools for a deeper understanding and analysis of evolutionary dynamics. 📊

The ultimate ambition of Seph's Biome is to develop a self-evolving robotic system that mirrors and augments natural biological processes and behaviors by the iteritive refinement of its employed GA for extentensive multimodal hyperparameter tuning of its RL model; for unsupervised learning.🌱🤖
