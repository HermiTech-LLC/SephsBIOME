## Overview

Seph's Biome represents a pioneering venture in the realm of robotic operating systems, blending the intricacies of robotics, computer science, and evolutionary biology. The project focuses on the exploration of artificial evolution, with the objective of replicating and analyzing complex biological behaviors in a computational environment.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites
- Python - latest release 🐍
- ROS Noetic (future updates to Foxy planned) 🤖
- Docker (optional) 🐳

### Setup
To begin, clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/SephsBIOME.git'
cd SephsBIOME
```

*Note: Full functionality will be available upon project completion.* 🌟
### Running the Project
Start the project using:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
An executable script (.sh) is planned for ease of use upon release. 😅

# The initial modal
for the "GA" management and tuning *(that is, The SephsBIOME Project)* is located at [this repository; for isolating building and testing](https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/SephMV)

## Evolution of AI Integration 🌐🔧

Seph's Biome is now integrating a more sophisticated AI approach, utilizing a neural network model comprising an RBM Layer and a Q-Learning Layer. This model is designed to learn and adapt to complex environments, such as the BipedalWalker-v3 environment in Gym.

The new model architecture includes:
- **RBM Layer**: Responsible for feature extraction and representation learning from the input data.
- **QLearning Layer**: Utilized for reinforcement learning and decision-making, optimizing actions based on learned rewards and penalties.

This integration marks a significant advancement in Seph's Biome, enhancing its ability to learn and adapt to dynamic environments, leading to more effective and robust robotic behaviors.


## Capabilities and Goals 🎯

Seph's Biome integrates concepts from robotics, AI, and biology, aiming to achieve:
- **Robotic Simulation**: Employing ROS to simulate realistic robotic behaviors across different scenarios. 🤖
- **Evolutionary Algorithms for Real-Time Optimization**: Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve and optimize complex robotic behaviors, now enhanced by integrating pre-trained DQN models for more effective learning. 🧬
- **Neural Network Integration**: Embedding advanced neural networks for decision-making and adaptive learning, leveraging the synergy between DQN and GA. 🧠
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Managing sensor data essential for real-time decisions and performance analysis. ⏱️
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Providing real-time visualization of key metrics to aid in understanding and analyzing the evolutionary and learning processes. 📊

The overarching goal is to create a self-evolving robotic system, emulating and enhancing biological processes and behaviors through iterative refinement of its GA for extensive multimodal hyperparameter tuning of its RL model, leading to an optimized system for multimodal functionality in a robotics context. 🌱🤖
