## Evolution of AI Integration 🌐🔧

Seph's Biome is evolving its AI strategy, transitioning from a custom model passed to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) at runtime for real-time optimization, to a more sophisticated approach. This new phase involves employing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) pre-trained in the Bipedal Walker environment in Gym. This pre-trained model is then fine-tuned and optimized using the GA component designed for dynamic, runtime adjustments. This shift allows for more efficient and effective learning and adaptation in robotic behaviors.

## Capabilities and Goals 🎯

Seph's Biome integrates concepts from robotics, AI, and biology, aiming to achieve:
- **Robotic Simulation**: Employing ROS to simulate realistic robotic behaviors across different scenarios. 🤖
- **Evolutionary Algorithms for Real-Time Optimization**: Implementing genetic algorithms to evolve and optimize complex robotic behaviors, now enhanced by integrating pre-trained DQN models for more effective learning. 🧬
- **Neural Network Integration**: Embedding advanced neural networks for decision-making and adaptive learning, leveraging the synergy between DQN and GA. 🧠
- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Managing sensor data essential for real-time decisions and performance analysis. ⏱️
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Providing real-time visualization of key metrics to aid in understanding and analyzing the evolutionary and learning processes. 📊

The overarching goal is to create a self-evolving robotic system, emulating and enhancing biological processes and behaviors through iterative refinement of its GA for extensive multimodal hyperparameter tuning of its RL model, leading to an optimized system for multimodal functionality in a robotics context. 🌱🤖
