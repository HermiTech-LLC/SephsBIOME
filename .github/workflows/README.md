# GitHub Workflows for SephsBIOME

This `.github/workflows` directory contains workflow files for GitHub Actions, which are used to automate the SephsBIOME project's continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Overview

The `main.yml` file is the central workflow configuration for this project. It defines the series of steps that GitHub will execute when certain conditions are met, such as when a new commit is pushed to the repository.

## Workflow Description

- `main.yml`: This file contains the definition for the project's main CI/CD pipeline. It likely includes steps for checking out the code, running tests, building the project, and possibly deploying it to a server or publishing it to a package registry.

## Usage

To trigger the workflow, you can typically push changes to a specific branch, create a pull request, or use other events specified in `main.yml`.

## Customizing Workflows

You can create additional `.yml` files to extend the automation. Each file represents a separate workflow that can be tailored to different processes such as building branches, handling releases, or managing pull requests.

## Support

For any questions or issues related to these workflows, please refer to the repository's Issues section or the documentation on [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
