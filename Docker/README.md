# Docker Configuration for SephsBIOME

This directory contains the Dockerfile and associated configuration files for creating a Docker container for the SephsBIOME project.

## Overview

The Dockerfile provided here is used to create a containerized version of the SephsBIOME application, ensuring consistent, reproducible environments for development, testing, and production.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Docker container for SephsBIOME, you will need to have Docker installed and running on your machine.

### Building the Container

To build the Docker image, run the following command in this directory:

\```bash
docker build -t sephsbiome .
\```

This will read the Dockerfile and build the image, tagging it as `sephsbiome`.

### Running the Container

Once the image is built, you can run the container using:

\```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 sephsbiome
\```

This will start a container running the SephsBIOME application, accessible at `localhost:8000`.

## Customization

If you need to customize the Dockerfile or the container's environment, you can edit the Dockerfile directly or provide environment variables using the `-e` option with the `docker run` command.

## Support

For any questions or issues, please refer to the main project's Issues section on GitHub or reach out to the maintainers.
