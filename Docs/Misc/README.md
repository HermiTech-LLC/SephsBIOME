# 📂 Docs / Misc

This subdirectory within 'Docs' is the eclectic collection of SephsBIOME's ancillary documents. 🌟

## What's Inside:

- `AperiodicSeph.ipynb`: 📓 An exploratory Jupyter notebook, diving into an initial hypothosis for exploring aperiodic pattern re-integration; potentially via classification or encoding with GA optimization to enhance the models through identifying aperiodic patterns with benificial constants.

- `LICENCE.md`: 📜 The legal document detailing how the material can be used, modified, and distributed.

- `SEPHSbiome_AperiodicAnalysis.md`: 🔍 A markdown document providing an in-depth analysis of aperiodicity in simulated environments.

- `SephsPulseCheck (1).ipynb`: 💓 A Jupyter notebook for periodic health checks on the models, ensuring robust performance and reliability.

I invite you to peruse these documents to gain a more nuanced understanding of the project's peripheral yet pivotal components.
