# ðŸš€ Model Evolution Chronicles - Versions Directory

This directory holds the evolution of the SephsBIOME project's models, with each Jupyter notebook representing a distinct version.

## Directory Overview:

- `SephModelV4.ipynb`: ðŸ”„ Version 4 introduces new feature integrations and enhancements to the optimization process, significantly improving model performance.

- `SephModelV5.ipynb`: ðŸ”§ Version 5 refines the previous model's architecture for increased efficiency and accuracy, incorporating the latest in machine learning research.

- `SephModelV5_(1).ipynb`: ðŸ§ª An alternative take on Version 5, this notebook experiments with different configurations and parameters to evaluate potential improvements.

I meticulously document each step in these notebooks, capturing the development and fine-tuning of algorithms critical to the project's success.
