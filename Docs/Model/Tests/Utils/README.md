# 🛠 Utils Directory

Welcome to the `Utils` subdirectory, where I have stored utility scripts and notebooks that aid in the testing and analysis for the SephsBIOME project.

## Contents:

- `BrownCorpus.py`: 📖 A simple Python script I authored to download the Brown Corpus. It's designed to run in Pythonista 3, providing a foundational dataset that I later integrated into my synthetic data generation notebooks.

- `SynthDGenV2.ipynb` & `SynthDGen.ipynb`: 🧪 These Jupyter notebooks reflect the progressive stages of my work on synthetic data generation, enhancing the datasets with each version.

- `synthetic_datasetV2.csv` & `synthetic_datasetV3.csv`: 📈 Comprising versions 2 and 3 of the synthetic datasets, these CSV files are the product of rigorous testing and refinement I conducted for improved data quality.

Each tool in this directory has been carefully crafted to streamline the development and analytical processes of my project. 🌐
