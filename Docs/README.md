# 📁 Docs Directory

Welcome to the 🧠 knowledge hub of the SephsBIOME project. This is where I document my voyage through the complex landscapes of computational biology and machine learning.

## Inside the Docs:

### 🗂 Misc
In the `Misc` folder, you'll find a collection of my project's creative chaos 🎨 - the serendipitous ideas, notes, and brainstorming gems that have propelled my project forward.

### 📊 Model
Venture into the `Model` folder to unravel the fabric of my AI models. Detailed documentation 📚 on the neural network architectures, evolutionary strategies, and simulation protocols awaits you. It's the storyboard where our data narratives take shape.

Each document is a gateway to understanding the intricate workings of SephsBIOME. Immerse yourself! 🌟
