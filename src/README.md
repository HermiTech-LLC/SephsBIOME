# 🧬 SephsBIOME Source Code Directory

The `src` directory is the central nervous system of SephsBIOME, containing the Python scripts that drive my project's functionality. 🧠💻

## Files and their purpose:

- `bipedal_robot.py`: 🤖 The script that defines the mechanics and control algorithms of Physical sensor and actuator data; for bipedal robots, as well as, the PID/physics and actuation of simulated robots.

- `evolution.py`: 🧬 Contains the evolutionary strategy logic, managing the selection and mutation processes to evolve the models.

- `genome.py`: 📜 Holds the definitions for the genetic encoding of traits within synthetic RL Agents.

- `individual.py`: 👤 Represents an individual RL agent within the simulations, tying together the genome and the neural network.

- `main.py`: 🚀 The entry point for running the simulations, orchestrating the flow from initialization to execution.

- `neural_network.py`: 🧠 Defines the neural network architectures, including layers and training procedures.

- `performanceViz.py`: 📊 Script for visualizing the performance metrics of the models over time.

- `sensor_data.py`: 📡 Manages the generation and processing of synthetic sensor data for simulations.

- `simulator.py`: 🌐 Simulates the environment in which the digital organisms (*RL Agents adapted for simulated action space via network model iteration; evolving, through simulated cummulative reward via optimized synthetic data AND real-time sensor input for NLP and kinematic behavior model optimization via GA over time) to re-inforce data interaction VIA ROS2 and evolve state adaptability and informed responses...
