# 🧬 SephsBIOME Source Code Directory

The `src` directory is the central nervous system of SephsBIOME, containing the Python scripts that drive our project's functionality. 🧠💻

## Files and their purpose:

- `bipedal_robot.py`: 🤖 The script that defines the mechanics and control algorithms of our simulated bipedal robots.

- `evolution.py`: 🧬 Contains our evolutionary strategy logic, managing the selection and mutation processes to evolve our models.

- `genome.py`: 📜 Holds the definitions for the genetic encoding of traits within our synthetic organisms.

- `individual.py`: 👤 Represents an individual entity within our simulations, tying together the genome and the neural network.

- `main.py`: 🚀 The entry point for running our simulations, orchestrating the flow from initialization to execution.

- `neural_network.py`: 🧠 Defines the neural network architectures, including layers and training procedures.

- `performanceViz.py`: 📊 Script for visualizing the performance metrics of our models over time.

- `sensor_data.py`: 📡 Manages the generation and processing of synthetic sensor data for our simulations.

- `simulator.py`: 🌐 Simulates the environment in which our digital organisms interact and evolve.
